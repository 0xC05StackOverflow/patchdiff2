==========

IDA binary differ. Since code.google.com/p/patchdiff2/ seemed abandoned, I did the obvious thingâ€¦

Note
====

The IDA provided makefiles seem ancient and more work than needed. I will change the Makefile to be more easily digested and to not rely on weird build systems.

Windows note
============

The vs/ directory wasn't deleted, but I don't have the means to maintain it. If anyone has patches for it, please submit them.
